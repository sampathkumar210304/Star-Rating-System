# Star-Rating-System
 âœ¨ Excited to share my latest project: Star Rating System! ðŸŒŸ
I recently completed this interactive project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can dynamically rate their experience. This was a fun and rewarding challenge that helped me refine my front-end development skills.
A big thank you to hashtag#Udemy for providing such insightful courses that guided me throughout this journey. The structured content and hands-on approach truly make learning enjoyable and practical! ðŸ™Œ
ðŸš€ Always thrilled to learn, build, and grow in the world of development. Feel free to connect or share your thoughts
